<p style="font-size: large">We have started to work in a new company. Our manager decided that during the process of our on-boarding
we will try to complete and develop the project which was long forgotten.
Application translator that should allow us to translate from English to Russian.
However, currently the application doesn't work and our first task is to check why it's not working.
</p>
<p style="font-size: large">
First off all we have to become more familiar with the app we will be working and check it's structure.
</p>

<p style="font-size: large">What we want to find out:</p>
<ol style="font-size: larger">
    <li>How classes interact with each other</li>
    <li>What is the main purpose of each class</li>
    <li>Where we store the translations</li>
</ol>
