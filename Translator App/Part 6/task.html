    Despite the fact that csv file dictionaries was a great improvement over in memory versions,
    in the age of the internet company decided to discover some internet based dictionaries and services.
    We got a new implementation of our Dictionary and should introduce it to our application, however,
    this doesn't mean that we should get rid of csv file dictionaries.
